## [01. drawing](01.drawing/index.html) 
-for this prompt i created an emoji of "self reflection" hence the half face half mirror, I used this coding train tutorial (https://youtu.be/c3TeLi6Ns1E?si=saEJwaGffL3Afe64) as the emoji is just a few simple shapes, which honestly, was quite challenging for me to do at first. But!!! after I managed to code the emoji, i wanted to push myself and add an animation. Which i think added depth to the idea of "self reflection" making it more alive and meaningful.

## [02.movement](02.movement/index.html)
- For this prompt i created an interactive piece where lines move and change color based on the mouses position. I found learning about the mouseX and mouseY function really facinating to experiment with as it allowed me to make the artwork respond to user interaction. The end product being a lively and dynamic artpiece, that users can create ever-changing unique patterns with. I especially enjoyed exploring how small changes in code can dramatically change its visual outcome.

## [03.multiples](03.multiples/index.html)
- For this prompt I used this coding train tutorial (https://youtu.be/POn4cZ0jL-o?si=uKWyjOXpZw25cYxp) with this I created the background after learning about the random() function. I experimented by adding equal amounts of green to make things more vibrant. The resulting background reminding me of the overconsumption of halloween, the abundance of colorful circles filling up the screen felt like the overwhelming amount of sweets and decorations during that time. After seeing this link I added a eye layered above the "sweets", and animated the pupil to enlarge and retract constantly, representing the greed and glutoney from capitalistic holidays like halloween.

## [04.media](04.media/index.html)
- For this prompt i used these 2 tutorials (https://youtu.be/i2C1hrJMwz0?si=cMz1En6Ipr8U1zv1) (https://youtu.be/Pn1g1wjxl_0?si=Vi4z0JijN1PPGpwy), to add a picture of a kitten that plays jazz once clicked on, whilst also capturing the reaction of the user.
- I found this prompt the hardest and at first couldnt get my code to run at all, my issue was my image and audio had been saved in the complete wrong directory so the code couldnt run because neither files could be found. I also found obtaining the audio challenging because at first i tried to turn a youtube video into a mp3 file but ran into too many issues- so i ended up downloading from a free website online- before this exercise I didnt even know what mp3 was! 
So although this project took longer than expected and seems quite simple, I'm proud of the outcome as it taught me how to add external media to code.
