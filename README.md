## 01. Drawing-
-for this prompt i created an emoji of "self reflection" hence the half face half mirror, I used this coding train tutorial (https://youtu.be/c3TeLi6Ns1E?si=saEJwaGffL3Afe64) as the emoji is just a few simple shapes, which honestly, was quite challenging for me to do at first. But!!! after I managed to code the emoji, i wanted to push myself and add an animation. Which i think added depth to the idea of "self reflection" making it more alive and meaningful.

## 02. Movement- 
- for this prompt i created an interactive piece where lines more and change color based on the mouses position. I found learning about the mouseX and mouseY function really facinating to play around with. The end product being a lively and dynamic artpiece, that users can create unique patterns with.

## 03. Multiples- 
- for this promt I used this coding train tutorial (https://youtu.be/POn4cZ0jL-o?si=uKWyjOXpZw25cYxp) with this I created the background after learning about the random() function. i experimented by adding equal amounts of green to make things more vibrant. The resulting background reminding me of the overconsumption of halloween-the abundance of colorful circles filling up the screen felt like the overwhelming amount of sweets and decorations during that time. After seeing this link I added a eye layered above the "sweets", and animated the iris to enlarge and retract constantly, representing greed and glutoney. 

## 04. Media-
currently i cannot get this piece of code to run- i used these 2 tutorials (https://youtu.be/i2C1hrJMwz0?si=cMz1En6Ipr8U1zv1) (https://youtu.be/Pn1g1wjxl_0?si=Vi4z0JijN1PPGpwy) i added a kitten png with jazz playing in the background when mouseclicked however the code doesnt run. Neither of those things have a correlation i just enjoy both.
